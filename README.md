### How does it work?

*StoryTeller* follows the official Dungeons and Dragons character creations steps.  

#### STEP 1: Choose whether you want to create a new character or load one.
  
When you run the program, you will be asked whether you want to **load** a character or **create** a new one.  
  
##### Loading a character

If you select to **load** a character, StoryTeller will automatically load the files with the `.stc` extension located in the `characters` folder in your *StoryTeller* installation folder.
