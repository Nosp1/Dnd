Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.(The Common word for such meditation is âtrance.â) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep."
